# SwitchPressAlarmClock
Arduino project done by team Arduiner, Ewha girls' highschool 2020

This alarm clock can press your light switch automatically.

You will need following stuffs;

Mini Servo motor (It will press your switch)

DS1302 clock module

1602 LCD dlsplay (To show current time and date)

Passive Buzzer (Sing alarm bell)

Timer consent (To set the alarm easily. our clock rings bell when power is supplied)

Breadboard sheld (To make whole circuit as tiny as possible)

Wire and plug to supply power to arduino


We also used 3D printer to make perfect case to cover the alarm clock and attach servo moter on the switch pricisely.
Finding precise distance between the wall and servo is important.
